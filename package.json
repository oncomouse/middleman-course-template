It uses YAML to create the schedule of instruction and [Middleman's vast array of supported languages](https://middlemanapp.com/basics/templating_language/) for page content. It uses bits of [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) for responsive navigation and some layout. It also is heavily customizable to create unique, course-specific layouts.",
